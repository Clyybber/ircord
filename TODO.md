Bugs:
- When using # to mention a channel in Discord, the IRC message looks like that:
<Yardanico> So Discord's <#371759607934353448> was separate from IRC's #nim-offtopic for a long time
- Some crashes, need to find and fix all of them (probably most of them are in discordnim due to outdated definitions of Discord API objects)


Features:
- Command support to allow OPs (or people from predefined nickname list) to an people on Discord from IRC

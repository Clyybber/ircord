Bugs:
- When using # to mention a channel in Discord, the IRC message looks like that:
<Yardanico> So Discord's <#371759607934353448> was separate from IRC's #nim-offtopic for a long time
- Same for Discord emotes like :nim1:, :nim2: etc
- Some crashes, need to find and fix all of them

Features:
- Handle mentions from IRC
